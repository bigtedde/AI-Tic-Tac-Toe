# Tic Tac Toe w/AI

Tic-Tac-Toe, this time with AI built in.

Started by created a game domain, including game logic and validators. 

Currently, I am working on adding in the game engine

Next I will add in AI functionality.

Implemented rest of the game engine, as well as the console interface for the TTT board.

Run with command:

python3 -m console -X human -O random

Swap "human" with "random" as you wish

Next step: implement the AI functionality
